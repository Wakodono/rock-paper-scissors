# Rock Paper Scissors


## Description:

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play against the computer by selecting one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

### Features:

- Users can click on buttons to select their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- The computer's choice is randomly generated.
- The game displays the result of each round (win, lose, or tie).
- Running scores for both  the player and computer are displayed.
- The game ends when either the player or computer reaches a score of 5, and the winner is announced.

### Biggest Challenge and How It Was Overcome:

One of the biggest challenge faced during development was implementing the game logic to accurately track and display the running scores for both the player and computer. It was important to ensure that scores were incremented correctly after each round and displayed prominently for the user to see.

To overcome this challenge, the game logic was carefully designed to update the scores based on the outcome of each round. Additionally, functions were created to dynamically update the score display in the user interface. Through thorough testing and debugging, scores were accurately tracked and displayed throughout the game.
